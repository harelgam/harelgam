### 🧪 Projects
-  **Perimeter Identification of Traffic Congestion in Urban Networks Using image processing, RL and DL. (M.Sc. Thesis)**
  
  •	Designed Agent-based system detecting congestion via heatmap generation from simulation data. 
  
  •	Applied Graph Convolutional Networks (**GCNs**) capturing spatial dependencies in traffic networks.
  
  •	Trained the agent with Proximal Policy Optimization (**PPO**) using PyTorch and Gymnasium. 
  
  •	Leveraged Model parallelism across NVIDIA GPUs accelerating training.
  
  •	Funded by the Ministry of Transport.


-  **RAG** **Chatbot**
  
  •	Built a customer-facing RAG for automated Q&A from company documents.
  
  •	Automated document ingestion, chunking with unique IDs, and vector storage in ChromaDB.
  
  •	Implemented multi-query retrieval, relevance filtering, and fallback logic with LangChain.


-  **Custom ReLU in ResNet**  
  Researched performance effects of fixed α values in Custom ReLU layers on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10/100 datasets.
