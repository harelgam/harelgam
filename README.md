### 🧪 Projects
 **Perimeter Identification of Traffic Congestion in Urban Networks Using image processing, RL and DL. (M.Sc. Thesis)**
  
  •	Designed Agent-based system detecting congestion via heatmap generation from simulation data. 
  
  •	Applied Graph Convolutional Networks (**GCNs**) capturing spatial dependencies in traffic networks.
  
  •	Trained the agent with Proximal Policy Optimization (**PPO**) using PyTorch and Gymnasium. 
  
  •	Leveraged Model parallelism across NVIDIA GPUs accelerating training.
  
  •	Funded by the Ministry of Transport.


  **RAG** **Chatbot**
  
  •	Built a customer-facing RAG for automated Q&A from company documents.
  
  •	Automated document ingestion, chunking with unique IDs, and vector storage in ChromaDB.
  
  •	Implemented multi-query retrieval, relevance filtering, and fallback logic with LangChain.

**  Dynamic AlphaSteer: Adaptive Safety Steering for LLMs**

• Extended the AlphaSteer activation steering framework by introducing a Dynamic Gating Network that adaptively controls steering strength based on prompt semantics.

• Designed lightweight MLP-based controllers attached to internal transformer layers to predict the optimal intervention coefficient (λ) during inference.

• Resolved the safety–utility trade-off, achieving robust defense against jailbreak attacks (AIM, GCG) while preserving reasoning performance on GSM8K and Math benchmarks.


  **Custom ReLU in ResNet**  
  Researched performance effects of fixed α values in Custom ReLU layers on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10/100 datasets.
